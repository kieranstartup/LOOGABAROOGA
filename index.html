<div id="chapter-1">
The material for this site has been produced by Europa and Peter Nencini in response to a commission by LU Arts. It is accompanied by three billboards sited around the town of Loughborough.
<br>
<br>
Loughborough is a mid size market town located in the very middle of England. You don’t need to look past the name before getting an indication of a more distinct character of place. ‘ough’ is one of the strangest letter sequences in the English language. It is pronounceable in no less than ten phonetic variations and Loughborough is the only word or name in English where it occurs twice.
<br>
<br>
Our work in Loughborough has engaged us with thinking about identity and place and a graphic designer’s role in relation to this. Much of our time visiting Loughborough has been seeking out the unusual bits that contribute to the character of the town – the ‘ough’ and the ‘ough’ rather than the ‘L’ and the ‘bor’.

IDENTITY FASCISM
</div>

<div id="chapter-2">
When places get branded an uneasy clash takes place. The world of profit and sales comes to define a place and a people. This raises questions of why a place needs to sell itself and who is it selling to?
<br>
<br>
A brand or graphic identity defines what something is, at the same time it therefore defines what it is not. The problem with it is that if the brand is for example colourful then it excludes a preference for monochrome, if it is playful then it excludes the serious, if something is friendly then it excludes the unfriendly. These are characteristics of a mixed society. No coherent graphic mark can embody such diverse contradictions. 
<br>
<br>
For the past five years we have been working with local councils and community groups on a variety of public realm projects. There is a general sense in the briefing of such projects that there is a lack of identity in these places. What is this place? What was this place? What could this place become? 
<br>
<br>
What we feel is the key requirement of responding to this task is how we can draw out and enrich a places cultural identity as opposed to trying to simplify it down into a graphic mark which would then be presented as a defining symbol of a place.
<br>
<br>
In these projects we often find ourselves looking for opportunities where graphic design can be useful: a wayfinding system, an identity for a community workshop, a temporary museum, a walking guide, still life photographs of products of an industrial estate, an identity for a community group. This creates a situation where a group can get together, have a graphic means of communicating, but at no point does this identity claim to represent everyone in this place. 
<br>
<br>
If an identity presents itself as being of a place then it is immediately oppressive. But there are many ways to graphically respond to a place without ending up with a defined brand. 
<br>
<br>
A brand has been created for Loughborough by the business improvement district. Love Loughborough is accompanied by a heart made up of smaller pictograms. The majority of these feel like that could be applicable to most English towns and cities however pictograms of the Carillon and the Sock Statue locate the brand firmly in Loughborough. 
<br>
<br>
The brand echoes perhaps the most famous piece of place-based marketing – the I Heart NY design by Milton Glasier in 1977. What Glazier’s identity does so successfully is allow the individual space for participation. If you choose to wear a bag or t-shirt that says I Heart NY choose to take part in the brand. You become the ‘I’ and assume a momentary illusion of authority. Love <span class="underline" id="image-2">Loughborough</span> doesn’t have this capacity for consumer participation. Instead it acts as a command where you are ordered to Love the Town. 
<br>
<br>
The second great thing about I Heart NY is its capacity for remix – I ‘pizza’ NY, I ‘orange’ NY are a couple of examples. The brand is so easily manipulated to give alternative messages yet each of the messages continues to reinforce a celebration of the city. 
<br>
<br>
But most importantly New York is perceived as a cultural capital of the world. So the idea that everyone goes to New York and immediately falls in love with it holds a certain amount of credibility. We feel that the same is not true for everywhere. Which reminds us of a bag designed by Martin Frostner and Jake Ford which declared ‘I Like My Town’. There is a <span class="underline" id="image-3">humble</span> beauty about this message which seems fitting. The words were inspired by this quote by Georges Perec from the Species of Spaces and Other Pieces:
<br>
<br>
‘I like my town, but I can’t say exactly what I like about it. I don’t think it’s the smell. I’m too accustomed to the monuments to want to look at them. I like certain lights, a few bridges, café terraces. I love passing through a place I haven’t seen for a long time.’

GRAPHIC ARCHAEOLOGY
</div>

<div id="chapter-3">
Places are made of stories. Our understanding of these stories defines how we think about a place, what we expect from that place and what we give back to it. How the stories are remembered and told is a political issue that defines a place – what stories dominate, and what stories that we allow ourselves to forget. 
<br>
<br>
Myths and folklore is created and passed down through tales and songs. These tales have provided a basis upon which the cultural identity of places are built. Stories get embedded into artefacts and buildings, objects, architecture and landscape which get leftover after the event, these are physical signs which hold onto narratives. In other situations stories are actively recorded in the urban fabric in the form of monuments – follies whose primary purpose is the act of remembering. History gets written by those with the money and influence to make such recordings. 
<br>
<br>
Most places have established stories that get told about them. In the case of Loughborough the presence of a company like Brush who build and export turbines globally becomes a characteristic of the town. The monumental Falcon Works overlooks the train station and the Brush social club extends the influence of the company further into he social fabric of the town. But there are more prickly stories too. Loughborough’s Immigration Control Centre registers immigrants based in the three surrounding cities of Nottingham, Derby and Leicester. What place is there which could be more relevant to a discussion on identity than the centre which grants a British identity to a lucky few of those who visit it. Two very different organisations both playing hugely significant roles in the town but it’s the Falcon works which provides the material suitable for the Loughborough’s postcard.  
<br>
<br>
Not every story can be told and many won’t feel relevant to a given project but as a working methodology we are interested in excavating these artefacts and assembling a new mythology out of the fragments of the past.

<div id="chapter-4-heading" class="large-text chapter-spacing">
ACCENT
</div>

<div id="chapter-4">
Where there is a need for visual communication there is a need for a graphic language. We are much more comfortable with the term ‘language’ than we are with ‘identity’. A language implies something which is pliable where as a identity implies something more ridged. 
<br>
<br>
We are most specifically interested in is the difference between our common language and the discrete variations of how something might be articulated in a specific place. A familiar example of this is the accent with which we speak but this is also true of how we communicate visually. The visual accent of a place is what we are often looking to unearth in projects like this. 
<br>
<br>
With this commission we have been looking to distinguish between what we feel is an English characteristic, what is a Loughborian characteristic and what is an individual characteristic. At this point we can start to identify what the accent of the place really is. 
<br>
<br>
A question that we keep coming back to is how we can we learn to speak in this voice or will we always be ‘putting on’ this accent?
<br>
<br>
We are interested in what we can bring to the place through our working there. We began as outsiders, looking at the town with the fresh eyes of a tourist. We feel this freshness provides us with both advantages and weaknesses over those who are familiar with the place. But through a process of discovery, time spent in the place and encounters with locals we begin this act of learning and processing before being able to articulate something back.

<div id="chapter-5-heading" class="large-text chapter-spacing">
AD-BRICOLAGE-HOCISM
</div>


<div id="chapter-5">
We take inspiration from the writings of Claude Lévi-Strauss and his discussion of Bricolage in the Savage Mind along with the writings of Charles Jencks and Nathan Silver and their spirit of Adhocism. Both texts describe ways of working which reuse existing materials in order to solve new problems. 
<br>
<br>
We often find that when you look at a found object they are often able to articulate things that humans cannot. A philosophy of design and production, of place and time, is embodied in each and every object.
<br>
<br>
By looking at the materials and forms at hand in a place, the byproducts of human endeavours, we get a sense of the layers of history that are necessary to construct a place. 
<br>
<br>
In Belco, Northern Ireland the local authorities felt that it was necessary to bring new life to the high street ahead of the 39th G8 summit where it would be on show to world leaders and press. 
<br>
<br>
In a number of shops the authorities installed printed vinyl in the windows which showed busy vibrant shops. The shop shown <span class="underline" id="image-1">here</span> was once a butcher shop but had gone out of business. 
<br>
<br>
Whilst we really enjoy this Potemkin village, this brilliantly executed illusion, we suspect it wasn’t intended in this spirit. Instead it shows a more somber longing for another time, a time when the high streets role within society served a different level of importance. By pretending like time and change hasn’t happened it feels like history is being denied. Pretending like nothing has changed since the 50s is not celebrating history, instead it denies the layers of change and complexity that make something old. 
<br>
<br>
Ironically the official theme of the 2013 summit was transparency.

ENCOUNTERS
</div>

<div id="chapter-6">
Loughborough is located at the centre of a triangle of cities, and the main roads out of town Leicester Road, Nottingham Road and Derby Road attest to this. As a market town Loughborough has served as a common meeting point between the cities traders. 
<br>
<br>
Our method of working in and understanding Loughborough has been through a method of triangulation – gaining a variety of viewpoints which allow us to build a more accurate picture of a place – and doing this through a series of organised and accidental encounters with local people.
